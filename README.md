This is a hobby project that intends to implement couple of useful and commonly used numerical methods of theoretical quantum many-body physics by leveraging the parallel GPU resources with CUDA.

For now, only the exact diagonalization algorithm for (arbitrary) Heisenberg model is implemented. The implementation supports the usage of Abelian symmetries and as such could be found perhaps useful.
